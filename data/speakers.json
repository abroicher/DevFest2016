		"bio": "Dr. Tatyana Goldberg is postdoctoral researcher who applies machine learning algorithms to answer various biological questions. In particular she is interested on creating computational methods that predict where proteins express in the living cell. Tatyana also focuses on understanding micro‐world warfare, that is predicting and identifying which bacteria can lead to infectious diseases. Tatyana is an ELES scholar who holds the prestigious Dimitris N. Chorafas award for excellence in research. She is also an experienced lecturer, who has been successfully leading students through scientific projects and international competitions such  as “The CAFA Challenge” and “Google Summer of Code.”",
