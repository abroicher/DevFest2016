In this talk we will give an insight into a 50 days journey that ended up with a result that has been featured in news media across the world, including Time, The Guardian, BBC and more. If you happen to be a data geek or a Game of Thrones nerd (or both) this talk is for you!",

Within this short period of time eleven TNG software consultants were able to implement a prototype which is based on an Oculus Rift DK2 and an Intel RealSense F200 3D-camera. With some additional days and a core team of about six TNG software developers we were able to add some more features for the Augmented Rift.",
